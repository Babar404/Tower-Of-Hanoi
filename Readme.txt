This is a project assigned according to Mips Assembly Language.

We converted a C language recursive tower of hanoi code into mips Assembly language.

To run this code you need to have the following softwares:


1. QTspim (QTSpim is a self-contained simulator that runs MIPS32 programs. It reads and executes assembly language programs written for this processor)

2. Any text editor to edit or write code, don't forget to change the extension of the file from .txt to .asm
